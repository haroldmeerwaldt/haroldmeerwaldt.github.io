### About me

I am an experimental physicist by training with a love for algorithms, software development, and data. I like working in an innovative environment, and have a lot of experience developing software, analyzing and reporting results, setting up and performing experiments, and designing hardware modules.

I began programming in QBasic during secondary school and I have been applying my skills ever since. Since then, I have programmed simulations, algorithms, applications with GUIs, measurement/control software, analysis tools, little scripts, and much more. From QBasic I quickly moved to other programming languages such as Mathematica, Matlab, and VBA, picking up a bit of C and SQL in the meantime, and have been very happy programming in Python for the last couple of years.

I am a big fan of PowerPoint. I like making slides with the results of experiments or simulations, after visualizing the data in clear graphs and analyzing them, to tell a story in pictures and words. I really enjoyed and am very proud of the articles I wrote in Physical Review B and Applied Physics Letters, my book chapter, various reports, and my PhD thesis. Sharing my insights with other people to me is slightly scary and incredibly rewarding at the same time.

My interest in algorithms and data has led me to the fields of quantum computing and data science, including artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and machine learning. I have given a live demonstration of the Quantum Inspire platform at an IEEE conference and hosted a workshop on hybrid quantum-classical algorithms using VQE. To increase my data science skills, I have obtained an IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, which involves databases, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning, using Python and SQL. I have also completed the 5-course Deep Learning Specialization from deeplearning.ai, involving deep, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks, object detection, and natural language processing.

Besides applying my quantitative skills, I like interacting with people: Iâ€™m easy to be around and I take the time to listen and help people. As a consultant in sustainable mobility policy, I got the opportunity to interview some 40 professionals, which led me to all kinds of interesting places and people. I have explored becoming a teacher; I love explaining things to people.

In my spare time I like singing and playing the piano. Together with others from my former band we recorded an album in a professional studio. I enjoy learning new languages and have obtained a B1-certificate (DELE) in Spanish. I can be found running and I read a lot of non-fiction books.
